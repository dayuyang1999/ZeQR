The COP26 event is a global united Nations summit about climate change and how countries are planning to tackle it. The term \u201cclimate change\u201d is often used as if it means the same thing as the term \u201cglobal warming\u201d. The National Academy of Sciences says \u201cclimate change\u201d is growing in favor of \u201cglobal warming\u201d because it helps convey that there are other changes in addition to rising temperatures.

First, pollution from burning fossil fuels is bad enough for the air we breathe, but many impacts of climate change also impact air quality. Second, as our climate becomes warmer, some insects will see their geographic ranges grow \u2013 bringing the Lyme disease and West Nile or Zika viruses they carry along with them to new regions. Third, melting ice caps, ice sheets and glaciers, as well as expanding warming waters, will lead to rising sea levels. Rising sea levels could push saltwater into freshwater aquifers, making the water unusable for drinking or irrigation. Finally, water pollution can have a multitude of negative effects on the environment, some of which can lead to even more problems. . Woah. They\u2019re not all bad, right?"

That\u2019s interesting. Tell me more. . For several years, there have been concerns that climate change negotiations will essentially ignore a key principle of climate change negotiation frameworks: the common but differentiated responsibilities. Realizing that greenhouse emissions remain in the atmosphere for a very long time, this principle recognizes that historically: Industrialized nations have emitted far more greenhouse gas emissions (even if some developing nations are only now increasing theirs); Rich countries, therefore, face the biggest responsibility and burden for action to address climate change; and Rich countries, therefore, must support developing nations adapt\u2014through financing and technology transfer, for example. This notion of climate justice is typically ignored by many rich nations and their mainstream media, making it easy to blame China, India and other developing countries for failures in climate change mitigation negotiations. .

Developing countries are the least able to adapt to climate change (and therefore called \"highly climate vulnerable\") due to their low levels of wealth, technology, education, and access to resources. Climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and diseases in developing countries. Interestingly, many people in developing nations who had never been educated about climate change have noticed local changes in temperature and precipitation patterns according to a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change. .

As important as this will be, a more significant demonstration of Biden\u2019s determination to rejoin the international fight against climate change will come in the form of the target the United States then puts on the table as its contribution toward meeting the goals of the agreement. In 2015, the Obama administration committed to reducing U.S. emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025. The beating heart of the Paris agreement is its requirement that countries ratchet up their ambition every five years. And even though the rollbacks of the Trump administration mean the United States will now miss this target, Biden has committed to quickly put the country on an even steeper trajectory of cuts by 2030, en route to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The new 2030 target will be an early signal of where the rubber hits the road internationally for the Biden administration. . And how are they doing?"

A homemade body scrub helps moisturize and exfoliate the skin, and with cold weather approaching it will make a killer gift this winter. It is simple to make and you can experiment with different sugars, Epsom salt, a variety of carrier oils, and essential oils. Feel free to get creative and fancy when making these scrubs; here is the basic recipe you can use to make a few batches. You\u2019ll need 2 cups Epsom salts or sugar (use organic cane sugar, brown sugar, or regular granulated), 1 cup carrier oil (grapeseed, olive, sweet almond, sesame, and safflower are all good), and 8-10 drops of your favourite essential oil. First, add Epsom salts or sugar to a bowl and slowly begin stirring in the oil until the mixture is smooth, but not goopy (You may not need the full cup of oil). Then, add essential oil and any other fun additions and mix well. Spoon into a decorative container or glass jar with a tight-fitting lid. You should choose sugar for fine grain homemade body scrub, and Epsom salts for a larger grain scrub. The oil will separate in some of these scrubs, so it\u2019s a good idea to attach a small spoon if giving away as a gift. . Cool. What about the second one?"

In June 1972, Nixon authorized members of his secret unit, as well as CREEP, to pay a team of burglars to infiltrate the Democratic Party's headquarters at the Watergate complex. This was before the election, and the burglars were meant to acquire information on his opponents. These undercover individuals broke into several Democratic offices within the Watergate and installed wire taps and recording equipment. Unfortunately for Nixon, the equipment was installed haphazardly and had to be readjusted. As the intruders attempted to return to Watergate and resolve the problem, they were arrested. The White House immediately attempted to downplay the break-in, but behind the scenes, Nixon and his secret team were quickly using funds to pay for the silence and cooperation of the intruders. Nixon also made sure that the FBI remained out of the incident by forcing the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to persuade the intelligence community that the break-in was classified as a matter of national security. The Nation Reacts While Nixon thought he was able to successfully cover up the break-in at the Watergate complex, members of the press, Congress and legal experts began questioning the event.

The presiding judge, John Sirica, was unconvinced by the intruders' testimony that they acted solely in their own interest and that there was no connection to Nixon. Meanwhile, Congress intervened when the Senate organized the Watergate Committee to investigate the event. Needless to say, the walls were closing in around Nixon, and it became much worse. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, was convicted of engaging in illegal activities by federal prosecutors. When that information became public, Judge Sirica increased the pressure on the Watergate intruders. In March, Sirica finally achieved his desired outcome when one of the intruders released information linking CREEP to the break-in. The dominoes were now falling one by one. In May, another convicted intruder testified before the Watergate Committee and revealed additional information linking not only CREEP, but the Nixon Administration to the events at Watergate. Eventually, the Watergate Committee called on John Dean, who was Nixon's lead legal counsel, who testified to Nixon's involvement in the break-in and cover-up. Simultaneously, the one piece of evidence that Congress, as well as the federal prosecution, needed was Nixon's taped conversations in the Oval Office. . Did they get it?"

Nixon initially refused to turn over the tapes claiming executive privilege and instead campaigned for the Stennis Compromise, which called for Senator John Stennis, who was essentially deaf, to translate the tapes for Congress! Judge Sirica and Congress both refused the compromise and instead sent a special prosecutor for the case, Archibald Cox, to present Nixon with a subpoena for the tapes. In another outlandish move, Nixon used his executive powers to terminate Cox as a prosecutor in what became known as the ' Saturday Night Massacre .' Nixon Surrenders Nixon's intransigence and outright defiance failed to pay off. While Nixon attempted to release sanitized versions of his tapes, many had had enough. On July 24, 1974, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the case of U.S. v. Nixon that Nixon's use of executive privilege was not applicable in a criminal investigation. Within weeks of the decision, the House of Representatives approved the impeachment of Nixon on the grounds of obstruction of justice, violation of the constitution and the unlawful withholding of evidence. To make matters worse, a tape was released, known as the 'smoking gun,' which unveiled Nixon agreeing to a CIA cover-up of the Watergate break-in during a phone conversation in 1972. .

Due to this scandal, the republican party suffered and moved to the right on the political scale. Congress tried to limit presidential power in an effort to ensure a similar scandal never occurs again. Further, the American people also grew weary of big government. Further, as a result of Watergate, the presidential office was weakened, allowing the Soviets to expand. In addition, Watergate also led to the North Vietnamese regaining territory because the president was too busy with Watergate. Not only did this scandal affect the world, but it also hit the homeland hard. The Republican party was severely damaged; the American people lost all trust in Republicans. The Democrats gained 49 seats in the House and five in the Senate. The scandal helped wipe out a generation of Republican politicians. Leading to a democratic majority, which advocated less government, lower taxes, and more libertarian views. Another element that came out of Watergate was Congress's attempt to limit the campaign funding of presidents. Congress attempted to make the government more transparent with new laws and amending the Freedom of Information Act.

If (3) is true, then we almost certainly live in a simulation. In the dark forest of our current ignorance, it seems sensible to apportion one's credence roughly evenly between (1), (2), and (3)...

But different people pick a different n. Some think it obvious that (1) is true, others that (2) is true, yet others that (3) is true.\" As a corollary to the trilemma, Bostrom states that \"Unless we are now living in a simulation, our descendants will almost certainly never run an ancestor-simulation.\" .

While Organic Architecture does describe environmental concerns, it also embodies the human spirit, transcending the mere act of shelter into something which shapes and enhances our lives. While Organic Architecture does describe an expression of individuality, it also explores our need to connect to Nature. Using Nature as our basis for design, a building or design must grow, as Nature grows, from the inside out. Most architects design their buildings as a shell and force their way inside.

Rice made with tomatoes, onions, scotch bonnets, and chili peppers. There are endless variations on this recipe, but those five ingredients are usual constants.

The debate is so serious that on Jollof Rice Day (August 22), Nigerian and Ghanian Jollof rice are sampled to decide which tastes better. Interestingly, no one has given a definite answer as to which Jollof rice tastes better. Ghanaians say the grains in Nigerian Jollof rice are too fat and tasteless. Nigerians say the grains in Ghanian Jollof rice are too starchy. Nigerians are a bit forward and loud in their debate. On social media, they use a lot of videos, memes, gifs and pictures to throw a lot of shade on Ghanaian Jollof. Sometime in 2016, they even tried to get Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg to decide which Jollof tastes better. Hilarious! The Ghanaians are more on the defensive, trying to block and counteract the attack from Nigerians on social media. You won\u2019t blame them. With the ferocity of attack they get from Nigerians on social media, it\u2019s pretty easy to think Nigerian Jollof rice tastes better. Both dishes taste great, however, and it will be unfair to rate a dish above the other. Why? Both dishes are unique and they can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t be compared.

Nigerian Jollof is made with long grain parboiled rice. Long grain rice is not native to Nigeria but imported from Asian countries. A second difference is the method of cooking. The grains used in Nigerian Jollof have to be parboiled and washed a second time to remove the starchy content. Party Jollof rice is a popular trademark in most Nigerian parties and celebrations. This dish is legendary for its smoky taste. This dish is cooked over firewood and allowed to burn at the bottom to give it a smoky flavor. A significant spice used in cooking the Nigerian Jollof is the bay leaf, which also adds to its rich smoky flavor. Ghanian Jollof is made with basmati rice which is also known as Thai Jasmine rice. Basmati is a long slender grained rice with a higher starch content than the long grain parboiled rice. Basmati also has a characteristic aromatic smell. Like the long grain rice, basmati is not native to Ghana but imported from Asian countries, especially India. The basmati rice is not parboiled. Parboiling makes it soggy.  To prevent this, Ghanaians prepare the tomato stew and meat stock and use that to cook the rice at once. Ghanian Jollof rice is also spicier than Nigerian Jollof. While Nigerians use bay leaf as a key spice, Ghanaians use shito, an oily condiment made with hot peppers, ginger, shrimps and onion. Ghanian Jollof rice doesn\u2019t have a party version that is cooked over firewood. . They\u2019re quite different, aren\u2019t they? So what region did it originate from?"

Origins of Jollof Rice Jollof rice originates from Senegal and the Gambia where the Wolof people of that region invented the dish. No wonder Jollof sounds similar to Wolof. The Wolof people were also called the Djolof or Jolof tribe. It is believed that Jollof was invented by a woman who lived near the Senegal river delta. It is said that this woman substituted rice for barley during a barley shortage. Using rice, fish, vegetables and tomatoes she created a tasty dish which was called Jollof. The Senegalese also have another name for this dish, Thieboudienne. In Gambia, it is called Benachim (One pot). The Jollof recipe travelled from Senegal to the Gambia, Mauritania then to other West African countries. The Ghanaians and Nigerians mastered the recipe, became experts and are struggling for copyrights. A poll done in 2013 revealed that 40% thought Jollof originated from Ghana, 21% thought it originated from Nigeria, while 23% thought Jollof originated from Senegal. .

Although it is now absorbed into Nigeria, traditional rulers of the state are still recognized. The state occupied what is now the modern city of Calabar. The city-state was also a center of slave trade. where slaves were exchanged for European goods. The main ethnic group took out of Calabar as slaves were the Igbo, although they were not the most populous ethnicity in the area. Most slave ships that transported slaves from Calabar were English; around 85% of these ships were from Bristol and Liverpool merchants. Conditions were brutal. In 1767, six British slaving vessels were lying in the Calabar river at a time when the people of Duke Town and Old Town were feuding. By prearrangement with the leaders of Duke Town, the leaders of Old Town were invited on board for a conference to settle the dispute, with guarantees of their safety.

A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors. Ponzi scheme organizers often promise high returns with little or no risk. Instead, they use money from new investors to pay earlier investors and may steal some of the money for themselves.

Theoretically it is not impossible at least for certain entities operating as Ponzi schemes to ultimately \"succeed\" financially, at least so long as a Ponzi scheme was not what the promoters were initially intending to operate. For example, a failing hedge fund reporting fraudulent returns could conceivably \"make good\" its reported numbers, for example by making a successful high-risk investment. Moreover, if the operators of such a scheme are facing the likelihood of imminent collapse accompanied by criminal charges, they may see little additional \"risk\" to themselves in attempting to cover their tracks by engaging in further illegal acts to try and make good the shortfall (for example, by engaging in insider trading ). Especially with lightly-regulated and monitored investment vehicles like hedge funds, in the absence of a whistleblower and\/or accompanying illegal acts any fraudulent content in reports is often difficult to detect unless and until the investment vehicles ultimately collapse. .

A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return. However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes: In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a \"hub\" for the victims, interacting with all of them directly. In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly. Failure to recruit typically means no investment return. A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach, and often attracts well-to-do investors, whereas pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments. A pyramid scheme typically collapses much faster because it requires exponential increases in participants to sustain it. By contrast, Ponzi schemes can survive (at least in the short term) simply by persuading most existing participants to reinvest their money, with a relatively small number of new participants. .

Economic bubbles are also similar to a Ponzi scheme in that one participant gets paid by contributions from a subsequent participant until the inevitable collapse. A bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market (for example stock, housing, cryptocurrency, tulip bulbs, or the Mississippi Company) where prices rise because buyers bid more, and buyers bid more because prices are rising. Bubbles are often said to be based on the \"greater fool\" theory. As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme: In most economic bubbles, there is no single person or group misrepresenting the intrinsic value. A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which has much more in common with a Ponzi scheme compared to other types of bubbles. Ponzi schemes typically result in criminal charges when authorities discover them, but other than pump and dump schemes, economic bubbles do not typically involve unlawful activity or even bad faith on the part of any participant. .

Beef is the primary Argentine dish. Their version of the barbecue is called asado (beef grilled on an open fire pit) and it's a must when you gather with family and friends on weekends. Besides the meat itself, it's also very common to eat spicy sausages (chorizo), kidneys (ri\u00f1ones), sweetbreads (molleja) and small intestines (chinchulines): the famous parillada mixta.

The Pizza is always welcome and in Argentina, they taste really superb and there are lots of toppings. The traditional cuisine is called criolla and is represented by the empanadas - salty pastries which can be filled with meat, chicken, ham and cheese, etc. The regional cuisine offers dishes such as matambre (rolled stuffed steak cut in slices and served cold), locro and carbonada (meat and vegetable stews). .

Hydrogen boils at -423\u00b0F (-253\u00b0C); therefore, we must store it at -423\u00b0F, and to store and transport it, it needs a highly specialized storage container. LH2 rocket fuel is 12 times less dense than Kerosene. Therefore, an LH2 tank would be bigger in volume for the necessary propellant than an RP-1 rocket tank. Moreover, to prevent liquid Hydrogen from boiling off, the rockets need insulation from all heat sources, such as rocket engine exhaust, air friction during launch, and radiant heat from the sun. Hydrogen rockets need advanced metallurgy to prevent hydrogen embrittlement. Metals become brittle when exposed to the extreme cold of liquid Hydrogen. It also leaks very easily. Liquid Hydrogen can leak through tiny pores in welded joints. Liquid Hydrogen is costly too. An enormous amount of technical expertise is necessary to solve all these problems. SpaceX was starting a new space program with a clean-sheet design. Because of all these problems related to LH2, SpaceX did not choose Hydrogen for their Falcon rockets. .

What happens when corals die and the carbon falls into the ocean? . Carbon exists and circulates in the deep waters of the oceans as well, sometimes for many years, where it either settles into the sediment on the bottom or recirculates back to the surface via the process of thermohaline circulation. The oceans are also important storage (sequestering) location for carbon. Human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels introduce more carbon into the atmosphere which is taken up by the oceans and, in turn, makes the water more acidic. The disruption of this delicate balance in the carbon cycle will in time, reduce the amount of carbon the oceans are capable of sequestering. . How can we stop the bleaching?"

In Infinity War, Rogers had spent two years as a fugitive, and the heroes who joined King T'Challa's army defending Wakanda couldn't be really considered a true Avengers team. But in Endgame, Captain America had the authority to make the call and by declaring every hero standing with him an Avenger, he unified the gigantic fighting force to the singular cause of beating Thanos once and for all. Cap making everyone fighting Thanos an Avenger in Endgame is a spiritual successor to Clint Barton's speech to Wanda Maximoff at the Battle of Sokovia in Age of Ultron. Terrified for her life, Hawkeye motivated Scarlet Witch to find her courage and fight, telling her, \"If you walk out that door, you are an Avenger.\" In Endgame, everyone who walked through a magic portal and joined the superheroes who travelled through time to resurrect them was an Avenger by Captain America's decree.

Steve was torn out of his own time and his hopes for a life with Peggy into the present day where he was a fish out of water fighting aliens as the ideal of \"Captain America\".

Before attempting to break into the tech or engineering industry, potential employers need to be able to see that you\u2019re a worthy candidate; having physical proof of your skills is much more powerful than relying on word of mouth alone. Learn HTML, write a program or build a website - these all prove that you have the skills to work in tech; even if you\u2019re a beginner, it still shows potential employers that you have the enthusiasm and willingness to learn. Using social media platforms will also help build your personal profile; LinkedIn accounts not only show up at the top of Google when a name is searched, which will increase your visibility and credibility, but it also lets you connect with industry professionals who may be looking to hire. .

Noble argues that search algorithms are racist and perpetuate societal problems because they reflect the negative biases that exist in society and the people who create them. Noble dismantles the idea that search engines are inherently neutral by explaining how algorithms in search engines privilege whiteness by depicting positive cues when key words like \u201cwhite\u201d are searched as opposed to \u201casian,\u201d \u201chispanic,\u201d or \u201cBlack.\u201d Her main example surrounds the search results of \"Black girls\" versus \"white girls\" and the biases that are depicted in the results. These algorithms can then have negative biases against women of color and other marginalized populations, while also affecting Internet users in general by leading to \"racial and gender profiling, misrepresentation, and even economic redlining.\" The book argues that algorithms perpetuate oppression and discriminate against People of Color, specifically women of color. .

Instead, the first hit was the site HotBlackPussy.com. The first page was filled with similar results. According to Google in 2010, \"black girls\" were defined not by history, interests, or aspirations. They were defined as porn. What accounts for such racist, sexist search results? Most people tend to attribute Google failures or glitches like this to public search patterns; search engines return porn for \"black girls\" because those are the sites that people click on most. .

When you use a search engine, relevant results are extracted from the index and ranked using an algorithm. Algorithms may seem like \u201cobjectively\u201d mathematic processes, but this is far from the truth. Racial bias seeps into algorithms in several subtle and not-so-subtle ways, leading to discriminatory results and outcomes. Let\u2019s take a deeper look. The danger of automation Algorithms can get the results you want for the wrong reasons. By automating an algorithm, it often finds patterns that you could not have predicted. The legend of the neural net tank experiment demonstrates this limitation of algorithms. \u200b \u200b Automation poses dangers when data is imperfect, messy, or biased. An algorithm might latch onto unimportant data and reinforce unintentional implicit biases. For example, data scientist Daphne Koller explained that an algorithm designed to recognize fractures from X-rays ended up instead recognizing which hospital generated the image. That algorithm now incorporates irrelevant data and skews results.\u200b \u200b Imagine if an algorithm is exposed to racially biased data sets: it will continue to incorporate those biases, even in a completely different context. By training an algorithm on that dataset, it learned to automatically filter out any \u201cblack-sounding\u201d names. The algorithm selected candidates on purely subjective criteria, perpetuating racial discrimination. This same form of automated discrimination prevents people of color from getting access to employment, housing, even student loans. Automation means we will create blind spots and racist biases in our so-called objective algorithms. . In terms of their ranking though, how does it work?"
